Am trying my best to achieve my goal of becoming a great programmer.
so far have learn  how to solve HTML problems using tags like <h> for headings, <p> for paragraphs, <strong> for bold, <em> for italic, <img> for images, <ul> and <ol> for unordersd and ordered lists respectively ETC.
Have learnt how to use the terminal to create folders and files and also navigate through different files and folders.
Have again learnt how to veiw view my webpages and how to edit them and how to copy codes into the browsers and terminal.
I have now gained a skill of using shortcuts which also known as going the lasy way.
Have also learn how to clone and upload files and folders onto the GitHub.
Hope by the end of the course I will be able to make much more projects.
